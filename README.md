mathematics file sharing

this can be used to sync and backup important work within groups and between personal and computer lab computers

[discord](https://discord.gg/SjrFFMhBFW)

There should be a directory for every class, eventually. If you don't see yours, add one.
Inside of each class directory, you can make your own personal or group directory for backing up your homework or syncing files between group members.

We're just starting but this has the potential to become our most powerful study tool.
